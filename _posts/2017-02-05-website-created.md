## Welcome

The domain - [http://theh2h.org](http://theh2h.org){:target="_blank"} is owned by the team and  on a whole it is build on [jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} (static website designer).
Hosting any website is a tedious job, and requires some investment - but we have [github pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"} to  the rescue . -hosting  made free.  

Everything has a purpose... so does the  website. We are striving hard and we don't want the community to stay behind. For purpose of keeping the community updated, anything and everything the team is working on will be put up on the [posts link](http://theh2h.org/posts) . 


moving forward ; 
This website will also act as  a link for connecting people from our social handles to the telegram group, so that the volunteers abide by the terms and conditions before joining the group. If you aren't a member yet, [Join Now](https://theh2h.org/tc)

That's it for now.

-Thank you for stopping by.
