##What is it going to work?

'A group of people working together towards a better society ' is what we are.

We provide help for those who need it and those who ask for it .What kind of help u ask?       Everything( except financial services). We are limiting our services to Bengaluru but if this 'idea' takes flight we would like to help a greater number of people . What makes us stand out is that money is not our primary motive , helping people is .


Like what we do ? 
Be a part of this group and feel the joy that comes from helping people . If you like helping people out and expect nothing but a smile in return then join us. Help people out and the person that helps people out the most gets featured on our social links every week . We cant help everyone but everyone can help someone ,all you need is a kind heart and a helping hand.
 _**Help others, make each day count.**_
